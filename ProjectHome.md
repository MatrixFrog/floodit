I found this fun little game on the iPhone called [Flood-It](http://www.labpixies.com/iphone/flood/) and I thought I would try to clone it in Java, to work on my Java/Swing skills, and also so that I could play it on my computer, since I don't have an iPhone.

To play the game, make sure you have Java installed, then just download and run the .jar file.

Do you know if there is a more generic name for this game? I'm sure it's been cloned before, and I imagine there is a widely accepted name for it.

You should be able to just check out the code and run it, as long as you have Apache Commons on your classpath. Let me know if you have any problems.

If you have any comments or questions about this project, please let me know, or file an issue on the issue tracker.
